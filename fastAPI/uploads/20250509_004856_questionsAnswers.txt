Morocco’s ENSA system, established in 1997 with the first school in Tangier, represents a premier network of 12 public engineering schools under the Ministry of Higher Education. These institutions follow a rigorous academic model inspired by France’s Grandes Écoles, offering a five-year program divided into two distinct phases: a preparatory cycle focused on mathematics, physics, and computing, and an engineering cycle where students specialize in fields such as computer science, telecommunications, energy, logistics, and even cybersecurity. Students can also access ENSA through a three-year route if they hold qualifications like DUT, DEUG, or CPGE.

ENSA schools are geographically dispersed across cities such as Agadir, Al Hoceima, Safi, Fès, Oujda, Tangier, Marrakech, and Tétouan—each developing niche programs. For instance, ENSA Safi is known for its unique program in Ceramic Materials Engineering, while ENSA Tétouan stands out with advanced offerings in Big Data, AI, Cybersecurity, and Logistics. Berrechid, the most recent addition, began in 2018 with a focus on aeronautics and data systems. Students entering ENSA go through a competitive selection process that includes a national exam, and their ranking determines which specialization they can pursue.

Beyond academics, ENSA promotes vibrant student life through various clubs—especially in Kénitra where robotics, renewable energy, and IT groups are highly active. Some campuses, like ENSA Marrakech, go further by supporting entrepreneurship through dedicated incubation units. International collaborations strengthen the system, including double-degree programs with French institutions like INSA Lyon and ISTIA Angers, and research partnerships with universities in Canada such as Université Laval.

With more than 95% of ENSA graduates securing employment, the return on investment is substantial. Alumni enter fields like energy, IT, and telecommunications, often working with major employers such as OCP Group, Maroc Telecom, and Renault. This employability stems from the hands-on training students receive through internships, industry-aligned curricula, and strong academic-industrial integration. Overall, ENSA offers a holistic, globally competitive engineering education that continues to evolve with technological and industrial demands.
